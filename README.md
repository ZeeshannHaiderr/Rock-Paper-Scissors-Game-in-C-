# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-in-C-
In this game you play with computer, where the computer's choice is generated randomly and the user makes his own choice by entering it.
I have used the random function generator to generate the computer's choice for the game which is then compared with the user's choice which is entered by the user.
The result is evaluated upon the game defined rules.
You can also enter the number of rounds you want to play this game.
